# Graphable JSON

Graphable JSON is an idea for using GraphQL with a REST API. GraphQL allows client developers to define only what they need and the API responds with the requested data. Graphable JSON is similar in that it allows client developers to specify the shape of data. It differs in that it will provide the requested data by following links and paginated collections to get the data.

Though this does not solve the problem of overfetching, it does let client developers forget about resources, URLs, and HTTP requestsâ€”they ask for what they need and that's all. For API developers, it lets them evolve their API without fear of breaking the client.

## How it works

When a URL and query are given to the Graphable JSON client, the library will request the URL and look for the properties and related objects directly included that response. If they are there, it returns the values it found. If the properties are links instead of values by way [RESTful JSON][RESTfulJSON], it will follow those links and provide the response values. If the links are for [collections](#Collections), it will follow `next` links and return all of the items from the collections.

This library makes use of asynchronous generators. This means the library will not follow all of the links it finds but rather follow them only when the client asks for the next item. The data will be lazily resolved so only the used data will be requested. This allows API developers to convert values into links to help clients make use of caching and reduce response sizes. The smaller the responses, the better.

Lastly, Graphable JSON allows for thinking about relationships rather than JSON structures. For example, a customer may have an `email` relationship, and this could mean there are no emails, one email, or many emails. The Graphable JSON library will treat the following examples of a customer the same.

```js
// No email
{}

// Email is null
{ "email": null }

// One email
{ "email": "jdoe@example.com" }

// Multiple emails
{ "email": [ "jdoe@example.com", "jdoe2@example.com" ] }
```

This works because of the use of generators. When it's undefined or `null`, the library will never yield a value for `email`. When there is one, it will yield one `email`. And when there is an array, it will yield each one individually.

The relationship of the data is defined by links instead of nested URLs. The Graphable JSON library does not care how links are constructed. Rather it will follow RESTful JSON links to find related data. Though a link may result in additional HTTP requests, it can allow clients to cache parts of the API depending on caching policies. Since it does not care about the links, it means that data can be moved around the API without breaking clients. APIs can be evolved over time.

## Install

Run the following to install the library:

```sh
npm install graphablejson
```

There is an example API found `https://graphablejsonapi.glitch.me/orders/1000`. You can also view the [GraphQL example](./examples/graphql-example.js) directory to see how this library can be used.

## Usage

### `gqlQuery`

The `gqlQuery` function is takes a URL and query and retrieves the requested data. Support is limited at this point. It takes a URL and a GraphQL AST and returns an object with async generators. This allows the client to lazily load the data from the API instead of requested all of the URLs at once.

It requires you to have `graphql-js` and something like `graphql-tag` to be able to pass in an AST.

```js
// Expecting the following result for the URL:
// https://graphablejsonapi.glitch.me/examples/example2
//
// {
//   customer_number: "8000",
//   order: [
//     {
//       url: "https://graphablejsonapi.glitch.me/orders/1000",
//       order_number: "1000",
//       total: 150,
//       unit: "USD"
//      }
//   ]
// };

const gql = require('graphql-tag');
const { gqlQuery, utils } = require('graphablejson');

const result = await gqlQuery('https://graphablejsonapi.glitch.me/examples/example2', gql`{
  order {
    order_number
    total
  }
}`);

// expandObject will follow links until the object is full expanded
console.log(await utils.expandObject(await result));
```

This makes use of all the functionality listed below. It will follow links and paginated collections.

### `getProperty`

## Technical Details

This section gives a look into how the library handles responses.

### Web Aware with RESTful JSON

The library will follow links represented in [RESTful JSON](https://restfuljson.org) if it finds one in place of a property. This allows for API responses to evolve without breaking queries.

Let's say the current document we have is an `order` and looks like:

```js
{
  "order_number": "1234",
  "customer_url": "/customers/4"
}
```

And the customer found at `/customers/4` is:

```js
{
  "first_name": "John",
  "last_name": "Doe",
}
```

The query below will request the data and resolve the link. If the data were included in the first response, it would return it, but since it's linked, it will follow the link to get the data.

```js
const { gqlQuery } = require('graphablejson');
const gql = require('graphql-tag');

const result = gqlQuery('https://example.com', gql`
  order_number
  customer {
    first_name
    last_name
  }
`);
```

### Collections

Additionally, APIs may need to return a partial set of items and let the client request more if necessary by way of pagination. A collection object is used to make this possible. It wraps values with an `$item` property so the JSON can move from values, to arrays, to paginated arrays.

```js
// We'll say the following response is found at http://example.com
// {
//   url: 'https://example.com/customer/4538',
//   order: [
//     {
//       url: 'https://example.com/order/1234',
//       order_number: '1234',
//       total_amount: '$100.00'
//     },
//     {
//       url: 'https://example.com/order/1235',
//       order_number: '1235',
//       total_amount: '$120.00'
//     }
//   ]
// };

// Returns all of the order objects found directly in the object
const result = gqlQuery('https://example.com', gql`
  order {
    order_number
    total_amount
  }
`);
```

Below shows the same values changing to use a collection.

A collection is denoted by the `$item` property. Remember that values can be arrays or single values, so $item can be either an
array of items or a single item.

Here is the customer again, this time with a linked collection of orders.

```js
{
  "url": 'https://example.com/customer/4538',
  "order_url": "http://example.com/orders"
}
```

Here is the first page for the orders.

```js
{
  "url": 'https://example.com/orders?page=1',
  "$item": [
    {
      "url": 'https://example.com/order/1234',
      "order_number": '1234',
      "total_amount": '$100.00'
    },
    {
      "url": 'https://example.com/order/1235',
      "order_number": '1235',
      "total_amount": '$120.00'
    }
  ],
  "next_url": 'https://example.com/orders?page=2'
}
```

And the second page of orders.

```js
{
  url: 'https://example.com/orders?page=2',
  $item: [
    {
      url: 'https://example.com/order/1236',
      order_number: '1236',
      total_amount: '$100.00'
    }
  ],
  prev_url: 'https://example.com/orders?page=1'
}
```

The same query listed above will work for this. It will follow `next_url` links and return each item found in `$item`.

This however is not always the best method as including the items in the collection means we cannot cache individual items. To help, we can use links to each item and let the Graphable JSON client resolve the links. This makes use of the same pattern of linking to values by appending a `_url` to the `$item` property and making each item a separate link.

```js
{
  "order": {
    "url": 'https://example.com/orders?page=1',
    "$item_url": [
      'https://example.com/orders/1234',
      'https://example.com/orders/1235'
    ],
    "next_url": 'https://example.com/orders?page=2'
  }
}
```
